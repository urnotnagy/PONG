This is my replica with C++ for the famous arcade game PONG. I used SFML graphic library to render the graphics, and OOP principles to organize the classes and files.

##
You can run this game for yourself by simply installing SFML on your PC and running the visual studio file and building the program.
If you have trouble with this, please use refer to [building instructions](https://github.com/urnotnagy/PONG/blob/main/Building%20instructions%20for%20PONG.pdf) file

If you want to read more about the implementation of everything, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/urnotnagy/PONG/blob/main/PONG%20DOCUMENTATION.pdf)

## 
Easer egg: try to go to line 26 of main.cpp and switch the current color pallet with the commented one for dark mode!
You can also try any color combinations you like
